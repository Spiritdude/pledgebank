      Barnet Council will support residents who wish to clear snow by offering grit and spreading equipment. 
      Four residents must sign up to the pledge (one of whom will be the community grit keeper).  
  </p>
  <p>
      The council will provide advice and insurance cover.

  <p>
    If you would like to volunteer, you need to sign up to a pledge. If you can’t see your street, 
    then you need to start a new pledge.
