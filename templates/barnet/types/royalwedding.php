         The Royal Wedding of HRH Prince William and Kate Middleton took place on 29 April 2011. 
         It was a wonderful excuse for a street party &mdash; not only is a street party a fun way for residents 
         to celebrate such an event, it&rsquo;s also a great way to get to know your neighbours better.
