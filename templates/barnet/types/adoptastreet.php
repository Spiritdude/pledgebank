     When residents sign up to adopt their street they will receive training from council officers 
     and be provided with appropriate equipment such as litter pickers, shovels and rubbish sacks.
     Prior to the winter months, 'adopted' streets will also receive a delivery of grit and 
     equipment to remove snow and spread grit on their pavements.

     After a highly successful trial, Barnet Council is offering similar support to an initial 
     10 streets who sign up to the scheme.
     To do this, we would like 6 households on each street to sign up to a pledge.
