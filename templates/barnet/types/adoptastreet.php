     &lsquo;Adopt-a-street&rsquo; encourages local volunteers to improve and care for their area by carrying out
     extra work which will make their neighbourhoods look more attractive, including planting, 
     gardening and litter sweeps.
  </p>
  <p>
     When residents sign up to adopt their street they will receive training from council officers 
     and be provided with appropriate equipment such as litter pickers, shovels and rubbish sacks. 
     Prior to the winter months, &lsquo;adopted&rsquo; streets will also receive a delivery of grit 
     and equipment to remove snow and spread grit on their pavements.

       What you will need to do:
   </h3>
   <ul>
     <li>
       Request to adopt your street &mdash; unless there is a pledge already set up for your street.
     </li>
     <li>
       Encourage your neighbours to sign the street pledge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once your pledge target is met then you will get training and equipment.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>
     What we&rsquo;re pledging: 
   </h3>
   <ul>
     <li>
       Barnet Council will support street adoption for 10 streets
       if at least six households in the street sign up to get involved. 
     </li>
   </ul>

 <h3>
   Can’t see your road? Start a new pledge! 
 </h3>
 <p>
   If there’s not already a pledge for your road, simply start one. Ideally, you’ll need to get a minimum of 6 households involved.

 <p>The PledgeBank team will . . .</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Set up a pledge page to help encourage people in your street to get involved and invite you to be the first to sign it
    </li>
    <li>
      If we&rsquo;ve created one already, we&rsquo;ll let you know so you can sign up to it
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After that, it&rsquo;s up to you to spread the word to your neighbours to get them to sign your pledge and get involved!
