  <p>
      <a href="http://www.barnet.gov.uk/biglunch">The Star Wars</a> is a very simple idea from the Eden Project. 
      The aim is to get as many people as possible across the whole of the UK to have lunch with their
      neighbours in a simple act of community, friendship and fun. This year it&rsquo;s happening on 
      <strong>Sunday&nbsp;5&nbsp;June</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
      A Star Wars can be anything from a few neighbours getting together in the garden or on the street, 
      to a full blown party with food, music and decoration that quite literally stops the traffic.              
      If it is on the street, you will need to get Barnet Council&rsquo;s permission to make sure it is OK 
      for you to close the road and sort out your insurance. To do this, we would like 3 households on each 
      street to sign up to a pledge.
