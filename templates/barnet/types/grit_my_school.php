       <p>
         If you agree to become a Community Grit Keeper you will need space in your property to store a one ton bag of grit (approximately 1m<span class="superscript">3</span> in size). If you do not have the appropriate storage space, we will put you in touch with the other volunteers that have signed up to your pledge so you can check whether they can store the grit supplies.

         Sharing your contact details with other volunteers

       <p>
         If you agree to become a Community Grit Keeper or volunteer, we will automatically share your contact details that with other participants in your school.

        Schools have the chance to take part and get parents and volunteers 
        to help clear access to the school.

    If you would like to volunteer, you need to sign up to a pledge. If you can’t see your school, 
    then you need to start a new pledge.
